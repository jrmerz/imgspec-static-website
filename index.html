  <h1>Imaging Spectroscopy Processing Environment on the Cloud (ImgSPEC)</h1>

  <p>
    The geospatial Imaging Spectroscopy Processing Environment on the Cloud (ImgSPEC; formerly GeoSPEC) pioneers an on- demand 
    science data processing system (SDPS) producing user-customized Level 1 calibrated radiance to Level 3+ data products in 
    anticipation for the 2017-2027 Earth Decadal Survey prioritized spaceborne global imaging spectrometer to advance the study 
    of Surface Biology and Geology (SBG). SBG data volumes (~20 TB/day) of high dimensionality (>224 bands) would be infeasible 
    to download and the breadth of applications of the data across dozens of disciplines presents a need to evolve the traditional 
    NASA SDPS. ImgSPEC streamlines processing data into key SBG observables that have demonstrated algorithms at local-to-regional 
    scales and may vary locally. As such, a traditional, monolithic SDPS could not fully exploit the information in SBG measurements. 
    To remove this barrier to use, ImgSPEC demonstrates an on-demand SDPS prototype that improves imaging spectroscopy data discovery, 
    access, and utility enabling shared knowledge transfer from advanced imaging spectroscopy users to less experienced users such 
    as decision makers and the general public. We test three use cases: 1) standard data processing workflows, 2) customized 
    variants of standard workflows, and 3) algorithm development of new workflows. We create collaborative algorithm development 
    environments that offer services typically restricted to NASA SDPSs such as data product provenance and bulk processing. We 
    leverage existing NASA-funded information technologies such as the hybrid on-premise/ cloud science data system (HySDS), the 
    Multi-mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP), ECOSIS - a crowd-sourced spectral database, and ECOSML - a crowd-sourced 
    model database. We demonstrate ImgSPEC on the Terrestrial Ecosystem use case processing through to foliar traits and fractional 
    cover, thus aligning with driving thrusts for the SBG Science and Applications Communities.

  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <h3>Context</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most recent Earth Science Decadal Survey was released by the National Academies in 2017</li>
    <li>5 Designated Observables (DOs) - the most highly recommended Earth observables to change the current understanding of the Earth System</li>
    <li>Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) - open data access global imaging spectrometer at regular repeat observation "Chemical Fingerprint of 
      the Atmosphere and Earth's Surface" = dozens of information value-added products</li>
    <li>Backwards compatible with a 30 year record = huge existing user base</li>
    <li>Barriers to use: Big data - volumes and processing</li>
  </ul>
